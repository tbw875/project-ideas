# Project Ideas Scratchpad

This document is a way for me to jot down and organize project ideas, the components of those ideas, and the steps necessary to build out those ideas.

It may evolve into a larger repository that I can use as a kind of project management or task warehouse.

## Projects

1. Weather CLI
A command-line prompt where I can simply type `weather` and it provides me the current temperature, chance of rain, and outlook for my current location.

2. Personal Finance Tracker
An app that ingests and analyzes annual spending data, showing trends and buckets transactions across multiple income and expense sources.

3. Recipe Manager
An app that provides a front-end service to a personal recipe database that I can build over time. 
A second layer could be figuring out which of my recipes I could make given contents in my fridge.

4. a PyGame project
Investigate using PyGame library on a simple game.

5. Data Analysis / TensorFlow practice
Utilizing datasets from Kaggle, build out models for categorical prediction on an unbalanced class set using different ML techniques.
